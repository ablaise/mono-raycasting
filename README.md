# MonoGame Raycasting

A very simple raycasting engine created with MonoGame.

This is mostly an impentation of the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm that works with basic mathematical knowledge using very simple trigonometry.

There is also an helper in the right-upper corner to help you visualizing the "rays" shot by the DDA algorithm.

Textures are ripped from Wolfenstein 3D.

# Limitation

This is a prototype, it's still a good way to learn how old games like Doom or Wolfenstein 3D worked. For now, there is a lot we can improve.

- Improving collision of player
- Adding textures for ground and ceiling
- Fixing a bug on neighbour walls
